# quizapp
This project features a user authentication system with both sign-in and login forms. Users can participate in quizzes, submit their responses, and instantly view their scores upon completion. Their past scores are stored locally using local storage, allowing them to track their performance over time. Additionally, the platform includes a built-in code compiler, enabling users to write and test code directly within the application.
